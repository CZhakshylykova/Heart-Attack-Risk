# Heart Failure Prediction 
This project leverages machine learning to predict heart failure outcomes and provides model explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). The workflow includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, and interpretable machine learning insights.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rithikkotha/heart-failure-clinical-records-dataset)
- The dataset contains medical records of patients with heart failure, including features such as age, anaemia, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and more.

---

## Main Features

- Comprehensive data exploration and cleaning.
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE.
- Predictive modeling using Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
- Model evaluation with ROC-AUC and other metrics.
