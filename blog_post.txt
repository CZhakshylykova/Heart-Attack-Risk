How to evaluate a model? 
-SSR: some of squared residuals; cave it has a pretty big problem - not super easy to interpret, depends on the amount of data you have. 
-The Solution for SSR is  Mean Squared Error ( = simply the average of the SSR).The smaller the SSR and MSE the better.
Unfortunately MSE is also not the best solution for the model evaluation, because on their own they depend on the scale of  the data. 
Both SSR and MSE can be used to calculate R2, which is independent of both the size of the daaset and the scale. 

How is R2 calculated? 
in R2 square you are interested in just the Mean
R2 ranges between 0 and 1, closer to 1 the better fits the model the data relative to the mean y-axis value.
